# Neuron
The Neuron Project S1

During the first week of the Neuron project, I coded the potential generated by a single neuron. 
My program asks the user for an external current I and a stop time(I transformed the stop time into step of time, by dividing them by h, the step of time, in order to get integers -> no floating point problems). T
The main program calls the method Neuron::update(I) every step of time with the given external current, until the stop time is reached. 3 things can happen :
a) The neuron is refractory -> The membrane potential stays intact
b) The membrane potential reaches the potential threshold(20 mv) -> The neuron spikes and the membrane potential is reset to its reset value(0 mV)
c) The membrane potential does not reach the potential threshold -> The new membrane potential is recalculated.
A document named simulator.txt saves the different values of the membrane potential at each step of time.

I plotted these values in excel and the graph looks how it should
